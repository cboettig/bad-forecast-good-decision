Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript, "Iterative forecasting and the trap of self-fulfilling prophecies," for consideration for publication in Ecology Letters.  
In this paper I show how models which produce accurate forecasts can actually lead to worse outcomes. 
Intuitively we associate that problem either to real world problems of implementation and incentives, or to the statistical problem of over-fitting.
I focus on a different mechanism that I believe has previously been overlooked by the extensive literature on ecological management under uncertainty,
and not easily resolved by any existing method. 
Using a well-studied example of fisheries management theory (often utilized in other conservation contexts as well), I illustrate how approaches that reduce model uncertainty through iterative updates, such as in the established paradigm of adaptive management or in the emerging paradigm of iterative forecasting,
can trap managers into making poor decisions.
In this simple example, a manager using either adaptive management or iterative forecasting to reduce model uncertainty winds up over-exploiting the fish stock, while simultaneously becoming increasing convinced that they are not over-exploiting the stock but are managing the resource more sustainably using more accurate models than they had started with.  
Further, I illustrate why such situations are easy to construct and difficult to dismiss as possibilities.



A shallow read of this manuscript may give the impression that it is a critique of adaptive management or iterative forecasting approaches.
As I illustrate in the paper, it is not -- any other model choice mechanism: goodness-of-fit, information criteria, cross-validation -- is subject to the same trap.
I focus on forecasting and adaptive management because they are the best of available techniques, so much so that it is easy to mistakenly believe they should avoid this trap.
I made this same mistake myself, thinking that because it maximizes utility instead of forecasting skill, that an adaptive management approach would avoid this problem.
In retrospect it is easy to see why it cannot, but then that is the point of a good example.  
I hope and suspect that other advocates of iterative forecasting or adaptive management, such as myself, would find this to be an informative a compelling treatment of a possible limitation to these important methods, rather than an assault on any previous work.
I look forward to the constructive feedback from your reviewers and editors.
