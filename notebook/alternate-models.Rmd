The model which gives the best forecast does not always lead to the best decision. 




- Model 1: A reasonable approximation model that does not produce very accurate forecasts, but nevertheless leads to good management decisions.
- Model 2: A reasonable approximation model that produces more accurate forecasts but leads to substantially worse management outcomes
- Model 3: The "True" Model: five-species model; functional forms and parameter values are never disclosed to the 'manager' but are used to simulate all data and management scenarios.


- Define a model
- Define action space. Under the assumption of fixed action, problem is not MDP and trivial to solve by sweep through possible fixed actions.

For the sake of argument, let us allow the model of Brias & Munch to represent the "true" model, which is unknown.
As researchers, we only have access to data derived from observations from the model. 
Let us consider a sample simulation of such data:


```{r}
df <- model_5sp(0, .0, sigma = 0.01)

df %>%
    pivot_longer(tidyselect::starts_with("x"),
                    names_to = "species",
                    values_to = "biomass") %>%
    ggplot(aes(time, biomass, group= interaction(species,r), col=species)) + geom_path() + ggtitle("Unfished")
```

Starting from the unfished equilibrium,

```{r}
df <- model_5sp(0, .58, sigma = 0.01)

df %>%
    pivot_longer(tidyselect::starts_with("x"),
                    names_to = "species",
                    values_to = "biomass") %>%
    ggplot(aes(time, biomass, group= interaction(species,r), col=species)) + 
  geom_path() + ggtitle("Optimally managed")
```

There are many other models, including process-based models, statistical models or even black-box machine learning models
which 5 dimensional state-space and two-dimensional action space. 



```{r}
## Three-species 'view' of the underlying dynamics, without fishing, starting all species from a low level

#true_observations <- model_5sp(0, 0., sigma = 0.05, x1o =.033, x2o = .033, x3o = .033, x4o = .1, x5o = .1, Tmax = 50)
true_observations <- model_5sp(0, 0, sigma = 0.05)


obs <- true_observations %>% 
  transmute(time = time, cormorant = x5, bass = x4, herring = x1+x2+x3, r=r) %>%
    pivot_longer(any_of(c("cormorant", "bass", "herring")),
                    names_to = "species",
                    values_to = "biomass") 
  

obs %>%
    ggplot(aes(time, biomass, col = species, group = interaction(species,r))) +
    geom_path(alpha=0.4)
```


Now consider an alternative model which ignores some of this biological complexity:
Our alternate model has several oversimplifications:
(1) it treat all three herring species as a single species,
(2) it fails to capture the coupled predator-prey dynamics between bass and herring, 
(3) it oversimplifies the cormorant dynamics, assuming the cormorant population is determined to be a fixed fraction of the herring,
and ignoring the impact of cormorant's predation on the herring itself.
(4) Lastly, our model will overestimate the mortality introduced on herring by a given fishing effort.
These elements are all obviously wrong, but not so arbitrary as to be inconceivable as a candidate model.
Researchers frequently consider models which make oversimplifications all the time, and rely on model choice processes to weed them out.

The parameterization chosen for the oversimplified 3 species model can reasonably reproduce the unfished dynamics.
Under any harvesting regime or other influence that perturbs the system significantly far from the unfished equilibrium co-existence state of the model quickly reveals the poor forecasting ability of this model.
Nevertheless, solving for the optimal policy (under the same constraints of constant harvest fractions as we consider for the true model) results in a harvest policy which provides nearly optimal performance.


```{r}
model_3sp <- function(u_prey = 0,

Alternate model, also mistakenly treats the three species of herring as a single species, but does a better job capturing the predator-prey relationships.  This model also happens to produce better forecasts, but leads to worse decision:
