          , 
            A great deal of research to inform environmental conservation and management takes a predict-and-prescribe strategy in which improving forecasts about future states of ecosystems is the primary goal. But sufficiently thorough understanding of ecosystems needed to reduce deep uncertainties is probably not achievable, seriously limiting the potential effectiveness of the predict-and-prescribe approach. Instead, research should integrate more closely with policy development to identify the range of alternative plausible futures and develop strategies that are robust across these scenarios and responsive to unpredictable ecosystem dynamics.},

Using the Ricker model as a reasonable representation of the average stock–recruit relationship, approximate optimal policies are found for cases where there is parameter uncertainty as well as environmental variation, by employing a "wide-sense adaptive dual control" algorithm. This algorithm accounts for the future information value of any escapement choice as well as the effect on immediate yield. The algorithm indicates that escapements should be deliberately varied to obtain better information for future management, provided that historical escapement levels have not been extremely variable. Such actively adaptive, or probing policies will become progressively more important in the future as managers learn how to control escapements more precisely and thus eliminate natural sources of informative variation.Key words: adaptive management, stock–recruitment, escapement},

Dynamic programming is used to show that the optimum policy in such situations can involve active probing or experimentation with escapements. The optimum adaptive policy is usually difficult to compute, but generally may be closely approximated by a "Bayes equivalent" policy that is simpler to estimate but does not account explicitly for the value of information associated with allowing more extreme escapements. While there are various practical difficulties in estimating and implementing an optimum policy, it is concluded that regular probing experiments should be included in every fishery management plan.Key words: stock-recruitment, optimization, adaptive management, stochastic models},
